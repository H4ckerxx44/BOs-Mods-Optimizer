## Please read before using ‚ö†Ô∏è

This mod is renaming / moving your mod files, for this reason it is important that you have regular
backups in place.
I will do my best to implement corresponding safety features to avoid possible issues, but I'm not
able to cover all use cases.

## üëæAutomatic Server Bundle (one mod pack for client/server)

This mod automatically disable mods which are incompatible or not needed on the server side.
There is no longer the need to have a separated "server" and "client" mod pack only for the mods.

## üëæ Automatic Mod Cleanup

This mod automatically clean up duplicated files, by removing older versions.
This is helpful to avoid duplication issues and manual deleting of older versions.

## How to use the mod ?

Just add the mod to your mod pack and during the start on a Minecraft Client or a Minecraft Server
it will automatically optimize the mods in the mod folder.

If the mod is used on a server all client related mods will be automatically renamed to "
???.client".
The mod is mostly helpful if it is used on the server and the client side.
